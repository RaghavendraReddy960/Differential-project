# Differential-project
This is the project about various types of numerical methods for solving differential equations, with code implementation.
The following methods are implemented
1. Eulers method
2. Backward Eulers method
3. heuns method
4. Midpoint method
5. taylors method(3rd)
6. Rk method
7. adams method
Also the comparission of the methods is also implemented.
